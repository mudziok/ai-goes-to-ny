# An Ai Goes to New York

Web game based on the fantastic "A Fake Artist Goes to New York" party game with an AI centered twist. In the original, players take turns drawing a given prompt on a whiteboard aside from one player who has no information and has to blend in.

In this version though, all players know the prompt but one of them is a Tensorflow based AI trying to blend in with the players. At the end of each round all players vote on who they think the AI was. The goal is to convince others that you are the AI as you get points if others vote for you.
